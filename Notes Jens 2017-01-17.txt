When you get the electrode data, apply avalanche analysis

log-log plot like beggs 2003 paper

branching network

avalanche sizes

recursive network simulations:

induced avalanches, random inout to one neuron
	single input at a time
	compare with the poisson

poisson input, pick a subset and fire them, plot activity
	pick a subset and look at output
	define avalaches as the spikes in these subsets

	also do thresholding to get output and compare

definition of avalanches??

no separation of avalaches in vivo, there needs to be subsampling for
