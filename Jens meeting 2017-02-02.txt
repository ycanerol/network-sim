use only one seed, instead of spontaneous activation
this is proabably the reason log log plot wasn’t expected

spontaneous activity and subsample, is the next step
take the first 10 for subsample

10x10 nodes

bump at t for frame lengths right after linear part
t ~ 1/h
h: spontaneous activation

t vs h plot should look monotonous, it’s an interesting thing to see
